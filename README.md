# CSE-408-Software-Sessional--ISP-Connection-Subsystem-Project

This project aims at creating a platform to facilitate the connection establishment between NTTN, ISP(Internet Service Provider), and end users. The features include sending connection request to ISP and NTTN, accepting
requests from ISP and End Users, checking active user list and ISP list, check details of ISP and Users etc. The backend is implemented using Node.js. MongoDB is used as the database
and the frontend is implemented with React.

- Run "npm start" for starting the project on localhost.

We used local mongo database for  this project. If you want to populate your local database with data, there is a folder called "backup data" which contains all the data that's been used for this project. Also, to get an overall idea about this project, do checkout the ERD and Class Diagram files in ERD+Class Diagram folder. In case you just want to get a simple overview of the project, I am attaching the step by step outlook of the project in the folder named "Overview", just run the ipynb file inside the folder.
